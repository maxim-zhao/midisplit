MidiSplit
=========

This is a commandline tool that takes a MIDI file and splits it into a number of other MIDI files, each containing a single channel with no simultaneous keypresses. The purpose is to make it possible to separate chords and other polyphony to look better in renderings with [SidWizPlus](https://github.com/maxim-zhao/SidWizPlus).
